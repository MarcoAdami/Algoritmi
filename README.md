# Algorithms

In this repositories there will be all the cool implementation seen in my course of Algorithms and data structure, everything in c++.

## How to run these implementations?

1. clone the project.
2. create a input.txt file in the folder that you want to use and write in it the input data.
3. open the terminal in the folder you are interested in.
4. run the implementations using the command `<compiler_c++> <implementation_name>.cpp  && ./a.out`
